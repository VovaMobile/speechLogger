"""An NVDA add-on which logs, in real time, spoken output to a file or files.
This includes any output generated using the NVDA remote add-on.
Lightly based on suggestions sent to the nvda-addons@groups.io mailing list by James Scholes (https://nvda-addons.groups.io/g/nvda-addons/message/18552).
This add-on has no UI, and must be configured by constants below.

You have to define your own toggle gestures for this add-on, under the NVDA Input Gestures Tools category.
Look for "Toggles logging of local speech" and "Toggles logging of remote speech".

Since the path(s) must be edited in the source, you have to reload plugins (NVDA+Ctrl+F3, or NVDA restart) in order to change them.
(N.B. reloading plugins doesn't work for this at the moment, reason unknown.)

The log files are opened and closed for each speech utterance, because the original mandate for this add-on
was to have real-time saving of output.
That means lots of disk activity, and probably not wonderful performance unless writing to a RAMDisk or an SSD.

Note also that these files are never truncated, and must be managed manually or they will grow very large.
"""

# CONFIGURATION
#: Speech generated locally is output to this file.
#: Set to None to disable local speech logging.
LOCAL_LOG = r"%temp%\nvda-speech.log"
#: Speech collected from the NVDA Remote add-on is saved to this file.
#: If you use exactly the same path and name as LOCAL_LOG, then both kinds of speech are logged to the same file.
#: Set to None to disable remote speech logging.
REMOTE_LOG = r"%temp%\nvda-speech-remote.log"
